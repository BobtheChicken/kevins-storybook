NOTES

A BRIEF HISTORY OF TIME


## notes for the story. this was lore for a video game @ first but that's taking too long so now its just a story lol

at the very beginning, there were 4 races: humans, angels, demons, spirits

humans: live up to 80 years, really damn smart and innovative
angels: they have wings, born with op magic skills. *these are not good guys, they are just a race*
demons: wings, op speed & agility. *not bad guys, just a race*
spirits: blink in and out of existence a lot, they are incredibly op but no one can tell them what to do so they just kinda troll around

a while later, the big three were founded: the ninja church, the institution, the monks

ninja church: so this is the holy church. they are also ninjas cause ninjas are cool. the church people excel in anti-magic via cutting off vital magic conductor points in the body. they are incredibly physically trained, because as part of their pilgrimage to seek god they work really hard. the church's motto is to follow the way of the world, and to leave everything to god's will.

instution: believed in equivalent exchange, and taking advantage of the way of the world. they believe that the world was made to be used to its fullest potential. they were the pioneers of controlled magic and can use it expertly.

monks: build tech stuff. completely change the way of the world. the monks believe that the world really sucks and their job is to improve it. monks are based in the Giant Moving Mechanical Factory, a mech city on two legs. most physical technology in the world is due to the monks.

10 yrs prior: divine war

angels vs demons
big three remained impartial

a ton of angels and demons died. now the world is 90% humans, 5% demons, 5% angels. spirits left to their own world.

they were even, until the angel and demon leaders both dissapeared. angel tribe went up pillar of fate, while devil tribe went up pillar of rebirth. they ended up at mt. momoji, where the spirit world barrier was weakest. demon leader came back barely alive. angel leader came back dead. demons won war.

no one knows what happened that day.

demons formed government







AREAS:

New Key City: metropolitan city. monks pioneered it. there's a ton of new technology such as robots, moving buildings, big screen flying tvs, anything. Akiba-style area. Half of it is burned from robot beta tests gone wrong.

Taro City: suburban-sized districts. Institution is based here. Taro City has a ton of magical remnants, making the area around it perfect for mages. It is built along the river seto for water and irrigation purposes. rice farms are on the other side. In rice farms is a shrine to an old panda spirit.

Rice Fields: across the river seto from Taro city lies a ton of rice fields. deep inside the fields is a shrine to a peculiar panda spirit.

Giant Moving Mechanical Factory: the monks's pride. a giant mech over 20 meters all, on two legs. the GMMF moves from New Key City through the northern plains, taking stops at Xenatia and other cities in the North.

Kamore: just another small town/village in Momoji valley. Kamore happens to be at the base of Mt. Momoji. One Wing Tiger clan's base is here.

Yamaterasu: mountain rage from Mt. Momoji to the north-east. At 4:20 PM, sunlight shines and casts a shadow of a giant fox upon Mt. Momoji. The pillar of fate is in a valley in the Yamaterasu, which is now lost. No matter how many times people attempt to find the base of the pillar, they never reach it and end up on the other side of the mountains.

Kord Borehole: Angel hideout. They are working on creating a hole through the Yamaterasu in order to reach the valley where the pillar of fate is located. Church completely rejects the idea. Monks and mages support it, as the pillar of fate has been lost ever since divine war.

Malachite Forest: expanse of trees ranging from Momoji Valley to the northeren plains.

Dragon Rider's Village: a small mythical village seperated from the rest of the world. The base of the pillar of rebirth is here. No matter how many times people attempt to search for it, they can never find it. The only way to get into the valley of rebirth is on the back of a dragon.

Xenatia: demon capital of the world. This is where the demon empire rules from.

Pillar of Rebirth: where remnants of monsters and spirits that have died go. this is where the demon shogun first climbed to heaven.

Pillar of Fate: where loot comes down from heaven. where the angel king first went up.

Palms Beach: tropical isles. some kind of beach-spirit.

Singapore 7: water-based city. water irrigation flows upwards.

Senjokan island: island off the coast of palms beach. you need to take a boat to get here. there's a town on the island, and a row of a bunch of shops. at the end of the alleys, it opens up to a huge hill with a solitary gate over 50 meters tall.

perpetual spirit festival: activating the great Sprit Gate grants entrance to the festival. Sprits from all over the En come to celebrate. the festival never ends. the only way in/out is via spirit gates, wooden structures that can be used to transfer between worlds.

Endless Maelstrom: snow that kills everyone instantly. a single touch is death.

Amis: town right on the border to the endless maelstrom. its an old town with lots of history and folklore. legends talk of an elusive snow golem in the endless maelstrom, who slaughters all but the pure of heart.

Onman: town north of Yamaterasu. home to world-famous hot springs. giant daikon spirit is here.

Monpan Village: famous for rice cakes and cooking. mochi spirit

Solaris: town that praises the sun. fire giant devil bakemono monster spirit.

pillars: these are the key to venturing into the spirit realm above. The path starts from Mt. Momoji's shrine in Kamore. It is a giant loop. Next, the rice fields at Taro City host a sprit that must be pleased. The group then heads to palms beach, where a boat is taken to Senjokan island. The great Spirit Gate is the entrance to the perpetual spirit festival, but the gate cannot be activated. The group heads back to malachite forest, and cannot locate the base of the pillar of rebirth. However, hints of the dragon rider's village are spotted as if the village itself is moving. The group journeys through northern plains until arriving at New Key City. They camp there at the mall until the Giant Moving Mechanical Factory arrives, and the group hitches a ride on that to cross the river seto. They have arrived at Xenatia. They are driven out of Xenatia and run to the Yamaterasu. As they follow the river seto, the group sees the fox's shadow cast onto Mt. Momoji. Sprit buster is possessd by the great fox spirit, and emerges with her spirit memories back. They find the kord borehole, but nothing can be done to stop it. The group follows river seto back to taro city, and retrace their steps back to the great Spirit Gate. Sprit buster is able to activate it this time, allowing entracne to the perpetual spirit festival. It is here that the Dragon Rider is found. After many adventures, the group is able to escape from a floating spirit gate way above Senjokan island. The Dragon Rider swoops in to save them, bringing them to the village. Now in the spirit world, the pillar of rebirth's base lies before them. They venture up the pillar, reaching World's Pillar. The group meet up with RNGesus, unlocking new skills. They discover the truth: the pillars are actually a gigantic Spirit Gate. Mt. Momoji is so spiritual because half of it has been moving through the gate for centuries. The World Gate can be activated by the spirit of Mt.Momoji, spirit buster, leading the group to the Based God. However, as the group are about to complete the journey by going down the pillar of fate, the kord borehole hits its target. the pillar of fate starts to fall. unable to balance properly, the pillar of rebirth also falls. world's pillar falls and slices Mt. Momoji in half. Hope seems lost, but a closer look at the divine war shows hints of a third pillar: the one that the demon shogun descended from. The group venture to Xenatia. There they find a secret: the angel king lives. by fate, he has been reborn as the final pillar. Demons and Angels are already racing the top of the pillar. The group rushes through the pillar war, and reach the top. Based God is waiting. They are told that Mt. Momoji is vital to the structure of the world. spirit buster sacrifices herself, destroying the final pillar. angels and demons, all in the pillar, fall into various places of the world. falling from the sky, the group sees spirit buster's smile for the last time. the spirit side of Mt. Momoji appears, and the mountain is whole again. Yamaterasu's shadow, projected onto the new surface, now no longer shows a fox. Instead, at 4:20 pm every day, spirit buster can be seen in the shadow of Yamaterasu, smiling into the distance. Angels and Demons, no longer affected by the call of the final pillar, form peace and communities with the humans of their areas. the group visits senjokan island. they step through the great Spirit Gate, but the perpetual spirit festival has left. instead, they are greeted with the other side of the gate, displaying a magnificent view of Mt. Momoji, right at 4:20 pm. **fade to black**

Spirit Hunt:
	so basically once the group talks to the panda spirit, they know about the existence of other spirits. statues on Senjokan island represent the spirits that the group must locate to activate the portal. theres about ~10 spirits, and then the final spirit, Yamaterasu.
