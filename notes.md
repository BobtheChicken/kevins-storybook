NOTES

A BRIEF HISTORY OF TIME


## notes for the story. this was lore for a video game @ first but that's taking too long so now its just a story lol

at the very beginning, there were 4 races: humans, angels, demons, spirits

humans: live up to 80 years, really damn smart and innovative
angels: they have wings, born with op magic skills. these are not good guys and have no connection to god.
demons: wings, op speed & agility. not bad guys.
spirits: blink in and out of existence a lot, they are incredibly op but they r derps

a while later, the big three were founded: the ninja church, the institution, the monks

ninja church: believed in divine punishment, and follow the way of the world. train in art of ninja.

instution: believed in equivalent exchange, and taking advantage of the way of the world.

monks: build tech stuff. completely change the way of the world.

10 yrs prior: divine war

angels vs demons
big three remained impartial

a ton of angels and demons died. now the world is 90% humans, 5% demons, 5% angels. spirits left to their own world.

they were even, until the angel and demon leaders both dissapeared. both had gone to the top of mt. momoji, where the spirit world barrier was weakest. demon leader came back barely alive. angel leader came back dead. demons won war.

no one knows what happened that day.

demons formed government

class: strategist mage
strategy guy who wears a hoodie and looks badass. calm and collected. when he was a kid, he lived in a poor area (this is before divine war, so world is a mess cause the demons aren’t governing anything yet.). parents were assassinated when he was 5. he killed the assassin with his own gun. he sweet talked and took up a team of rebels. he is in a mech suit stolen from the monks, so they don’t know he is a kid. he leads the rebellion, invades the church of ninja, invade spirit transportations, invade the monk mobile factories of course, brought everyone under him for a year. when divine war came down, he dissapeared as the whole district was wiped out. he was still only 7. he escaped and went into hiding.

class: fighter
shonen guy whos all energetic and stuff. wears some kind of uniform. dad was a monk who was one inventor of the mobile factories. dad has white beard and glasses and always smiling. his dream was to construct a mech that could self sustain itself and venture out collecting data. unfortunately his dad was sent out to do repairs during divine war. he never returned. his mom went into depression until she seeked the comfort of the ninja church. she became so devout to the ninja religion that shonen guy almost never saw her.

class: speed assassin

class: pure power mage
girl with long red hair. grandpa is the leader of pmt art. father was a high mage in the Institution. He was respected for having the finest control over every part of magic. He died by being overwhelmed by over 200 ninjas. His last words on deathbed: *weakly smiles* “i realize now... even with absolute control, i am simply human. i can never reach the pure power of an angel or spirit.” girl: *crying*“i-i’ll do it. i’ll conquer all the power in the world for you, dad”. dad: “thank you, [name]”. then he died. she then set off on a quest for the ultimate power.


class: spirit buster
